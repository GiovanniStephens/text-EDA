This repo is for my text exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# Things to include:
- [x] Word counts (This can be done without SpaCy.)
- [x] Part of speech counts (SpaCy)
- [ ] <s>Number of documents </s>
- [x] Number of sentences (SpaCy or another library)
- [x] Top N entities (SpaCy)
- [ ] Distribution of entity types (SpaCy)
- [x] Top N part-of-speech words (SpaCy)
- [x] Sentiment distribution from each document (NLTK)
- [x] Top bi-tri words (SpaCy or something else)
- [x] Top N Noun chunks (SpaCy)
- [x] Most salient key-words
- [x] Word Density - Average length of the words used in the headline 
- [x] Punctuation Count 
- [x] Upper-Case to Lower-Case Words ratio - ratio of upper case words used and lower case words used in the text
- [x] Cluster labels to analyse things according to an unsupervised clustering of documents.

# To-do
1. [ ] Update the eda to include all the extracted features for each documents at a row level. Just comma-separate them. That way, when pulling the data into a visualisation tool like Power BI, you can simply word cloud the column by category to get category split features. (e.g. all keyphrases by category)
